# Relito-a-DIY-Project
The aim of this project is to get a hands on experience in creating a rear bicycle light from scratch using free software. The main workflow is first to create and simulate the circuit in LTSpice and then create the PCB design using KiCAD. 

# Part 1: Circuit Simulation using LTSpice
After doing a little bit of research, I have decided to use the [NE555DR](https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Texas-Instruments/NE555DR?qs=gb35HGp1gQJ5U8ZthvvoVQ%3D%3D)Timer IC to simulate the blinking pattern. The circuit diagram (which might be updated) can be found in the attached file called.


# Part 2: PCB Design using KiCAD
TBD
